              After nearly 7 years, we finally saw each other again — and it
              was the most beautiful moment. The second our eyes met, it felt
              like no time had passed at all. We were both so happy, smiling
              like kids who just found their lost treasure. That reunion
              reminded us that some bonds never fade, no matter how many
              years go by.

            <p>
              We had our own little world — and music was at the heart of
              it. Every single day, we'd pick a love song and put it in
              our Instagram bio, like a secret note only we understood.
              Those lyrics weren't just words; they were messages — our
              way of saying "I'm thinking of you" without saying it out
              loud.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then there were those nights on WhatsApp when you'd
              say, "Sing a song for me." How could I ever say no to you?
              I'd sing — maybe not perfectly, but with every bit of love
              I had. Some days I'd surprise you with a song on my own,
              just to hear you smile through the phone. Those melodies
              became ours — every note carried a feeling, every lyric
              told our story.

              On July 23rd, I hurt you — and the guilt haunted me every second
              after. I couldn't live with the thought of you being in pain
              because of me. So I made up my mind to come see you in Sivakasi
              that Friday, July 25th, to heal every wound I had caused.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when we finally stood face to face, something magical
              happened. Our eyes locked, and the whole world disappeared.
              No words were needed — just your eyes looking into mine, and
              mine into yours. In that moment, we both felt it — a love so
              deep, so mutual, so pure. It was the day our hearts spoke
              what our lips never could.

              Just two days after Sivakasi, I couldn't stay away. On
              July 27th, I came to see you right in front of your home.
              My heart was pounding — your mom was nearby, and I was
              terrified she'd spot me. But she didn't. You were there
              with your relation kids Lavanya and Raasu Kutti, and you
              bought paani poori for all of us. Watching you take care
              of everyone, sharing that simple street food together —
              it felt like family already.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then the very next day, July 28th — I was coming from
              office in the evening, and there you were, waiting for me
              near Regent, Thalir side. You came on your scooty with
              Lavanya and Raasu Kutti. The moment I saw you standing
              there, everything about my tiring day just melted away.
              We talked, we laughed, and I got to meet the little ones
              again.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then you did the sweetest thing — you bought me an
              Arun chocolate cone ice cream. Not for the kids, not for
              anyone else — just for me. That ice cream tasted like love
              itself. You always find the smallest ways to make me feel
              like the most special person in the world.

              Some nights, we'd fall asleep on video calls, and other nights on
              audio calls that stretched all the way till morning. No words
              needed — just the soft sound of your breathing made me feel like
              you were right beside me. Those sleepy calls made the distance
              disappear, and every morning I woke up still connected to you
              felt like the most beautiful thing in the world.

              You found it — an app called Groic. And it changed
              everything about our nights. We'd connect on it, play the
              same video song at the same time, and chat together while
              the music played. It was like sitting next to each other
              in a dark room, watching love songs on one screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              We shared so many romantic songs on there — Tamil love
              melodies that said exactly what our hearts felt. Sometimes
              we'd type sweet nothings in the chat, sometimes we'd just
              watch in silence, knowing the other person was feeling the
              same thing at the same moment. Groic became our secret
              date spot — no distance, no limits, just you and me
              falling deeper in love with every song.

              see you. You always knew I was coming. The moment you walked
              out of college and reached Kovilpatti, I'd already be there

            </p>
            <p>
              You'd hop on, and we'd ride to our quiet spot — just the two
              of us. We talked about everything, teased each other, laughed
              until our cheeks hurt, and in between all the fun, there were
              those soft moments of love that made the world feel like it

              264 days of never missing a single day, never forgetting

              me the one person who fills my life with love.
            </p>
            <p>
              That afternoon, you called me and said you were at
              D-Mart in Kovilpatti with your mom for shopping. My heart
              started racing. I wanted to see you so badly, but I was
              terrified — your mom was right there. Still, I couldn't
              stay away. I got ready and rushed to D-Mart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inside that store, we were both searching for each other —
              me peeking through every aisle, my heart pounding with
              excitement and fear. Then you told your mom, "I need a
              chocolate," and she said, "Go get it." That was our moment.
              You came looking for me, I came looking for you — and finally,
              between those aisles, we found each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              You were in a saree — and I saw you in a saree for the very
              first time. My breath stopped. You looked so incredibly
              beautiful. We only had one minute together, but we made it
              count — we took a selfie, our first secret treasure of the
              new year. One minute was all we got, but that one minute felt
              like the best start to any year I've ever had.

              A Full Day With My Vision in Grace
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes, I saw you in a saree at D-Mart on New Year's — but that
              was just one stolen minute. Jan 6th was different. This was
              the second time I saw you in a saree, but the first time I
              got to spend an entire day with you like that. A whole day —
              just you and me.
            </p>
            <p>
              And my God, you were breathtaking. The way you carried
              yourself with such effortless grace, the way the saree
              draped around you like it was made just for you — I couldn't
              look away. You weren't just the girl I loved; you were a
              masterpiece, a poetic blend of tradition and beauty. Getting
              to be with you the whole day, seeing that smile, that face,
              that Azhagi — it's a memory I'll hold close to my heart
              forever.

            <p>
              That same beautiful day — Jan 6th. You had a Pongal
              celebration inside your college, so you went in around 9:40
              in the morning. I dropped you off and watched you walk
              through those gates in your saree, looking like a dream.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then I waited. From 9:40 to 12:40 — three whole hours
              at the bus stop outside your college. People came and went,
              buses passed by, but I didn't move. Every minute felt long,
              but I didn't care. Because I knew that when those gates
              opened again, you'd walk out — and that one moment of seeing
              you again would make every second of waiting feel like
              nothing. The world can keep its plans; I'll keep waiting
              for you, always.

              Poorni, I know I've hurt you so many times — more than I can count,
              and more than you ever deserved. You have the most beautiful, sensitive
              heart, and instead of protecting it, I was the one who made it ache.
              Every tear you shed because of me breaks something inside me that I
              can never fully put back together. 😞
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm deeply sorry for every harsh word, every moment of carelessness,
              every time I made you cry or feel less than the incredible person you
              are. You didn't deserve any of it. You gave me nothing but love, and
              I gave you reasons to be sad. That's something I'll always regret. 💔
            </p>
            <p>
              I know sorry can't undo the pain, and I know your tender heart
              remembers every wound. But I want you to know — I see it now. I see
              how much I've hurt you, and it tears me apart. You are the most
              precious person in my life, and I promise to spend every day trying
              to be the reason you smile, not the reason you cry. 🥺

                  I don't even know where to begin — because loving you is something
                  that has no beginning and no end. It just exists, like the air I

                  me, and I want you to know every single feeling I've kept inside. 💕

                  🎁 <strong>June 6th</strong> — That was the day my world changed.
                  My birthday isn't until June 18th, but you couldn't wait. You
                  surprised me 12 days early with a boAt Immortal 131 Bluetooth
                  headphone. But honestly, the real gift wasn't the headphone — it was
                  realizing that someone in this world thinks about me that much. That
                  someone is you. That moment, I knew you were special. 🎧
                </p>

                <p class="memory-highlight">
                  🚌 <strong>July 25th, Sivakasi</strong> — I came to meet you, and
                  something shifted between us that day. We both felt it. It wasn't
                  just friendship anymore — it was love. Being close to you that day,
                  I felt like I had found my home. Not a place, but a person. You. 💗
                </p>

                <p>
                  And then there were those beautiful mornings — not every day, but
                  some days — when I'd see you on the bus. My heart would race the
                  moment I spotted you. Those bus rides became my favorite journeys,
                  not because of where they took me, but because you were there. 🚌💫
                </p>

                <p>
                  You know what I treasure the most? Every bus ticket you handed to me.
                  Most people would throw them away, but I saved every single one. They
                  sit in my memories box — tiny pieces of paper that hold the biggest
                  moments of my life. And that one earpiece jimmiki you gave me? I kept
                  that too. These aren't just things, Poorni — they're proof that we
                  happened, that this love is real. 🎟️📦

                  Sometimes I'd come to your college just for one glimpse of you.
                  Standing at the gates, waiting, watching — and the second you walked
                  out, the entire world lit up. You are the only person I've ever
                  opened my heart to. Every feeling, every fear, every dream — I've
                  shared it all with you and only you. You're my safe place. 🏫💝

                  👗 <strong>January 6th</strong> — I had always wanted to see you in a
                  saree. I waited and waited, but never got the chance. And then that
                  day came. When I saw you in that saree, I forgot how to breathe. You
                  were more than gorgeous — you were a dream standing in front of me.

                  gave us that ring box. We looked at each other, smiled, and slipped
                  those rings on each other's fingers. In that moment, without grand
                  gestures or fancy words, we said it all — <em>"I love you."</em>
                  That ring isn't just jewellery, it's a promise. A promise that I'm
