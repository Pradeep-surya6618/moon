              fabric; it was about the way you carried yourself with such
              effortless grace. In that moment, you weren't just the girl I
              loved; you were a masterpiece, a poetic blend of tradition and
              beauty that I'll cherish forever.

              Poorni, I know I've hurt you so many times — more than I can count,
              and more than you ever deserved. You have the most beautiful, sensitive
              heart, and instead of protecting it, I was the one who made it ache.

              I'm deeply sorry for every harsh word, every moment of carelessness,
              every time I made you cry or feel less than the incredible person you
              are. You didn't deserve any of it. You gave me nothing but love, and
              I gave you reasons to be sad. That's something I'll always regret. 💔
            </p>
            <p>
              I know sorry can't undo the pain, and I know your tender heart
              remembers every wound. But I want you to know — I see it now. I see
              how much I've hurt you, and it tears me apart. You are the most
              precious person in my life, and I promise to spend every day trying
              to be the reason you smile, not the reason you cry. 🥺

                  that has no beginning and no end. It just exists, like the air I

                  🎁 <strong>June 6th</strong> — That was the day my world changed.
                  My birthday isn't until June 18th, but you couldn't wait. You
                  surprised me 12 days early with a boAt Immortal 131 Bluetooth
                  headphone. But honestly, the real gift wasn't the headphone — it was
                  realizing that someone in this world thinks about me that much. That
                  someone is you. That moment, I knew you were special. 🎧

                  something shifted between us that day. We both felt it. It wasn't
                  just friendship anymore — it was love. Being close to you that day,
                  I felt like I had found my home. Not a place, but a person. You. 💗

                  And then there were those beautiful mornings — not every day, but
                  some days — when I'd see you on the bus. My heart would race the
                  moment I spotted you. Those bus rides became my favorite journeys,
                  not because of where they took me, but because you were there. 🚌💫

                  You know what I treasure the most? Every bus ticket you handed to me.
                  Most people would throw them away, but I saved every single one. They
                  sit in my memories box — tiny pieces of paper that hold the biggest
                  moments of my life. And that one earpiece jimmiki you gave me? I kept
                  that too. These aren't just things, Poorni — they're proof that we
                  happened, that this love is real. 🎟️📦

                  Sometimes I'd come to your college just for one glimpse of you.
                  Standing at the gates, waiting, watching — and the second you walked
                  out, the entire world lit up. You are the only person I've ever
                  opened my heart to. Every feeling, every fear, every dream — I've
                  shared it all with you and only you. You're my safe place. 🏫💝

                  👗 <strong>January 6th</strong> — I had always wanted to see you in a
                  saree. I waited and waited, but never got the chance. And then that
                  day came. When I saw you in that saree, I forgot how to breathe. You
                  were more than gorgeous — you were a dream standing in front of me.
                  So much cuteness on your face, avlo Azhagu! 😍 My Illavarasi, my
                  Teddy, my Meli, my Selfie queen — you looked like a painting that
                  God made with extra love. 🥰

                  💍 <strong>January 6th — The Ring</strong> — And then your friend
                  gave us that ring box. We looked at each other, smiled, and slipped
                  those rings on each other's fingers. In that moment, without grand
                  gestures or fancy words, we said it all — <em>"I love you."</em>
                  That ring isn't just jewellery, it's a promise. A promise that I'm
                  yours, and you're mine. Forever. 💍❤️

                  Poorni, you are my Azhagi, my Selfie, my Teddy, my Illavarasi, my
                  Meli — you are every beautiful name in this world because you
                  deserve them all. You're not just the girl I love — you're the girl
                  who taught me what love means. 🧸✨
                </p>

                <p class="letter-closing">
                  I love you more than yesterday, less than tomorrow, and with
                  everything I have today. You are my first thought in the morning,
                  my last thought at night, and every thought in between. Happy
                  Valentine's Day, my love. This heart beats only for you. 💓
